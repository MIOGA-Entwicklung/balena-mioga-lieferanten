  ## Usage instructions

  **Application download** Once you power up your device you'll need to allow
  some time for it to download the application, this typically takes 5-10
  minutes but it can take more depending on your internet connection and what
  device you are using.

  **Usage** When the download is completed the application will start. You
  should see a balenaSound broadcasted as a speaker on your bluetooth, Airplay
  and Spotify Connect streaming services. You can also access http://balena or
  http://balena.local to access balenaSound's control panel.
